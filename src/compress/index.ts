// (**) Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.

// If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced with a single copy of the element. The order of the elements should not be changed.

// [1,1,1,2,2,3,3,1,1,6,7,7,7,7] -> [1,2,3,1,6,7]

// start by defining the function:
// export function compress.... Good Luck!
